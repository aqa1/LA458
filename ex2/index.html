<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue; font-size: 24px;"> Breathtaking Beautiful Island</h1>
    <p> This page provides information of one of the most beautiful islands in the world.<br>
  I learned about this secluded island when I was about 16 and have only dreamed about visiting it one day ever since.</p>

<h2 style="color:pink"> Sparkling Beach Information </h2>
    <p>Located in the Indian ocean, south of India, the Maldives had enjoyable tropical weather throughout the entire year (between 84 to 90 degrees fahrenheit). The island Vaadhoo is famously known as the "sea of starts" or sparkling beach of the Maldives. The sparkling stars in the beach comes from bioluminescence, a process when plankton come in contact with oxygen and unleashes a chemical reaction that is caused from an enzyme names luciferase. </p>
